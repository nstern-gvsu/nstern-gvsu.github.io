* Applied Statistics

### Technical Expertise
My programming experience is primarily with Java as a part of the GVSU Masters in Applied Computer Science. The majority of my technical expertise is in the realm of phytochemistry, where my research focuses on characterizing and quantifying the various marker compounds produced by plants. This work is done via different chromatographic techniques, but is primarily through UHPLC or HPTLC combined with UV-Vis or mass spectroscopy.

## CIS641 Term Project
[*Team Moot Floating Point Git Repo*](https://ngboardway.github.io/GVSU-CIS641-Moot-Floating-Point/)

### CIS641 Term Project Description
*The term project that my team and I are working on is a homage to the popular arcade game called PacMan.  Our game, which we have named PacMeme, is a comical take on the classic game in which the sprites are based on popular memes of the past.  From a technical standpoint, the game remains very true to original.  Users will be able to maneuver their character through a maze, collect points by consuming collectibles, and avoid their arch enemies: the ghosts.  Players can turn the tables by consuming powerups that allow them to consume the ghosts or buy them some extra time to finish out the maze.  The game ends when players lose all of their lives, at which point players will be able to see if their score was high enough to put them in the top 10.  The game will have a menu and interface that is simple and intuitive, and we think users will enjoy our satirical spin on a perennial favorite.*
